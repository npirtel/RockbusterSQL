# RockbusterSQL
CareerFoundry data analytics course project for a fictitious movie rental company Rockbuster.

Like Blockbuster, Rockbuster was proposed to be a retail chain video rental company and was transitioning to an online streaming platform. In this theoretical project, I was hired by the Rockbuster Busniess Intelligence department to help with the launch strategy for a new online video service.

I uploaded all of Rockbuster's data into a RDBMS and used SQL to analyze data, answer specific queries, and put together a final presentation to create an overview  of the company and its inventory, conduct a market analysis, and give recommendations to improve future company profits.
